### Blazing Trails | 
- Blazing Trails is a serverside node web application that allows its users to search for camping and hiking locations, based on their input. They can type in a location, which will then create and generate a rendered results page of either hiking locations or camping locations, depending on their previous selection. From there, they can view information about each location, along with the current air quality and weather reports, again based off of their previous input. From this page, they can also save camping or hiking locations to their favorites page for future reference. They can also view a team bio page that give them more information about the application's authors.
